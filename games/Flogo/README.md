How would you pitch your game in one line? My game is a combination of a puzzle game and platformer, where a player (ball called flogo) encounters various obstacles that impact its motion (float, roll, etc), which you have to evade and go through the platformer-styled maze to reach the goal and to the next level. 

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The player goes through various physics changes throughout. For example, an obstacle can make them float while another can make them roll, bounce, etc. They can use this for or against them in order to go throught the platformer-styled maze. 

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) 
The objective is to successfully complete the level without dying or resetting. Levels will increase in complexity. If time allows, I plan to add additional achievements such as coins or make it timed.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? 
Given that it is a level game, players can be entertained by adding several levels, that will exceed 30 minutes play time. Adding different mechanics that are interesting throughout the levels will keep them engaged.
